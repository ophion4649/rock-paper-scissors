#Rock-Paper-Scissors!

Here is my code for the 2nd project of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

This project has introduced basic JavaScript. During the coding process the following topics in particular were encountered:

- JS function declarations vs expressions
- Type coercion and strict vs loose equality
- Debugging via Chrome Developer Tools
- Problem solving oriented thought processes
- DRY focused refactoring
